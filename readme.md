# Yatzy Game

## Description

This is a single-player Yatzy game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game follows the standard rules of Yatzy, where a player rolls five dice, chooses which to keep, and can reroll up to two times per turn. The player must place a score into an available score box, and the game ends when all score boxes are filled.

## How to Play

2. Click the "Roll/Reroll Dice" button to roll the dice.
3. Click on any dice to keep it for the next roll.
4. Click the "Roll/Reroll Dice" button again to reroll the remaining dice.
5. Choose a score category and click "Score" to place your score.
6. Repeat until all score categories are filled.
7. Your final score will be displayed when the game ends.
